# Feature deprecation process

Sometimes we need to deprecate user-facing features that we've already released. We follow this process to minimize the impact of that deprecation on both our customers and our internal teams. 

## Choosing to deprecate a feature

You should first determine the potential impact of the feature deprecation: 

- Are any users are using the feature? Who are they? Is there a workaround to replace their needs? 
- Are any other Sourcegraph teams using the feature, or a subset of its code?
- Are any sales prospects specifically interested in the feature? 

If the answers to these questions suggest that deprecation is the best path forward, you should next document the deprecation. 

## Documenting a feature's deprecation 

You should create a blog post to publish when we deprecate the feature. The blog post should contain:

- Why we're deprecating the feature
- The deprecation timeline
- Workarounds for the feature's users, if relevant

We use a blog post because it's publicly accessible, timestamped, and easy to send directly to any customers or prospects asking about the feature.
